here is much work that should be done to the code.

example:

Can someone explain why, if I declare and construct a VerseKey *vk
and then do a:

VerseKey copykey=vk->clone();

or even

VerseKey copykey=vk;

All the information from vk is copied to copykey, except that chapter
and verse are set to 1.  The Book number, and everything else gets copied
to copykey.
So right now I have in my code, the very ugly:

VerseKey copykey=vk->clone();
copykey.Chapter(vk->Chapter());
copykey.Verse(vk->Verse());



Is there any interest or effort in having sword compile for other machines?
It sounded like there was interest in palm, but what about other
operating systems like : mac os, bsd, solaris...
