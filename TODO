ToDo

Things I want to get done soon for irenaeus

next release should have:
	nicer emacs mode
		should have an interactive interface
		add support for greek and hebrew
        use filters
        finish write to personal commentary
	more documentation
        fix bugs (numerous visual glitches)       
            on some terminals, switching virtual windows, text from
            previous window doesn't get cleared first.

desire for later versions:
better windowing
implement more options available in the sword api: searching ranges, 
regexpr search, 
more mouse support
catch up in terms of functionality to what bibletime can do.
also compatibility with bibletime would be good (read config file?).
