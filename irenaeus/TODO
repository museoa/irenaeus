ToDo

Things I want to get done soon for irenaeus

next release should have:
	nicer emacs mode
		should have an interactive interface
		add support for greek and hebrew
        use filters
        finish write to personal commentary
        help screen
        fix bugs (numerous visual glitches)       

desire for later versions:
more windowing
implement the options available in the sword api: searching ranges, 
regexpr search, 
more mouse support
maybe a preliminary Tcl interface if it is easy to do. 
ability to choose a reference from search list or comm/ld/text, and 
go to the verse
catch up in terms of functionality to what bibletime can do.
also compatibility with bibletime would be good (read config file?).
