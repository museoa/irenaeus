What are the advantages of a program like irenaeus.

Sometimes you  only have a text based connection to a machine on which
you can install software (telnet).

some machines may have very limited graphical capabilities.
(hand held devices, although I don't know that sword runs on any
such devices yet.)

Interfacing to other programs such as text editors or scripts.

It can be called on the commandline, or interact through
standard io.  This means that it interfaces well with other programs.

So I can type :  irenaeus -c l James1:1

and I get:

 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, sends words of love to the twelve tribes of the Jews living in all parts of the earth.

In particular I have written an emacs mode.  This means that you
can easily insert biblical reference while writing a file.

in emacs I can type cntrl C, l, and then type James1:1, and get the verse 
in my emacs buffer.

Similarly you can do searches, read commentaries , write personal commentaries


If I decided that I needed to do a regular expression search, but regular
expresion searching isn't implemented yet, I can copy the entire bible to
a buffer: cntrl C l, then gen1:1-Rev22:21  
(I haven't actually tried this, but it should work)
I then have my editor do the regular expression search.


There is much work that should be done to the code.
